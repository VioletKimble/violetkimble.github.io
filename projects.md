The following projects are geared towards understanding existing research methods and creating more accurate research tools in fMRI.

**The Constrained Network-Based Statistic: A New Level of Inference for Neuroimaging**  
_Funded by NIMH K00MH122372_

Current multiple comparison correction procedures for functional connectivity inference do not account for dependence between non-contiguous connections or spatial bias arising from differences in measurements across the brain. This project seeks to address these limitations with a new a priori network-based multiple comparison correction approach, establish its empirical utility in the context of other correction approaches, and maximize its impact through modern open science practices.

**Improving Reliability and Validity of fMRI Statistical Methods**  
_Funded by NINDS F99NS108557_

Recent work has raised questions about the reliability and validity of major fMRI statistical methods. The first part of this project addressed open questions regarding the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity. The second part of this project evaluated sensitivity of common cluster-based inference methods used in activation mapping.

**BioImage Suite Web**

I am part of the [BioImage Suite Web (BISWeb)](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/) team led by Dustin Scheinost and Xenophon Papademetris (_R24 MH114805, PIs: Papademetris X. and Scheinost D_). BISWeb is a point-and-click app that runs in any modern web browser without any installation necessary, yet with performance rivaling that of a locally installed software. Due to the general nature of its architecture (C++, WebAssembly, JavaScript), BISWeb works on most modern web-browsers, major operating systems, and devices. Currently, BISWeb supports a range of functionality in human and animal neuroscience, from defacing to connectome visualization.
