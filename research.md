I have been fortunate to work in many labs as my interests are mainly focused on drug addiction and mental health using animal models and bioinformatic tools.

**Investigate the role of gut microbiome disruptions in a rodent model of opioid use disorder**
_Laboratory of Dr. Drew Kiraly_

I worked to establish a mechanistic link between the adolescent gut microbiome, the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and opioid self-administration. The current project will build upon our preliminary results to investigate the role of the adolescent gut microbiome on fentanyl self-administration and seek a mechanistic understanding of its influence by examining the contribution of the gut microbiome-derived metabolites in opioid reward behavior and chromatin modification in mPFC. My portion of the project was to test the hypothesis that adolescence is a sensitive period for microbiome-driven effects on opioid self-administration and opioid-induced histone modification.

**Using Protein Binding Microarrays to analyze DNA binding differences of Human Transcription Factor Isoforms**
_Laboratory of Dr. Martha Bulyk_

After learning that one of the top candidate genes driving sex-specific differences in cocaine dependence is a transcription factor (Nr4a1), I became inspired to learn more about gene regulation. I joined Dr. Martha Bulyk's Lab to understand how alternatively-spliced isoforms transcription factors (TFs) may have different biological effects on gene expression. Specifically, I utilized R to perform protein-binding microarray data analysis on the DNA binding patterns of the reference and alternative isoforms of two disease-associated TF genes: OTX2 and TBX5. I found differences in the DNA binding capabilities between reference and alternative isoforms of OTX2 and TBX5, suggesting possible biological function differences. My analysis expanded on existing knowledge of human TF binding diversity and pointed to the importance of understanding TF isoforms. As a result of this summer research experience, I presented both oral and poster presentations at the Virtual Leadership Alliance National Symposium (LANS), ABRCMS, and the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). Presenting my research at the various conferences gave me valuable experience in effectively communicating my science to the broader scientific community. As a result, I was recognized with an award for an outstanding presentation at SACNAS 2020.
