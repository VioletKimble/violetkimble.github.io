#**The role of gut microbiome disruptions in a rodent model of opioid use disorder**
>
_Laboratory of Dr. Drew Kiraly_

I worked to establish a mechanistic link between the adolescent gut microbiome, the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and opioid self-administration. My portion of the project was to test the hypothesis that adolescence is a sensitive period for microbiome-driven effects on opioid self-administration and opioid-induced histone modification. 


**Housing environment affects anxiety-like behaviors but not cocaine-induced sensitization in female and male mice**<br>
_Laboratory of Dr. Christina McKittrick_

I investigated the effect of housing conditions on behavioral responsiveness to cocaine and on anxiety-like behavior in both female and male mice. We observed that the housing environment affected anxiety-related behaviors but not the sensitization response suggests that these behavioral processes involve distinct neural pathways. In addition, the robust behavioral sensitization to cocaine exhibited by both female and male mice supports the routine inclusion of females in studies of substance use disorders.   


**Using Protein Binding Microarrays to analyze DNA binding differences of Human Transcription Factor Isoforms**

_Laboratory of Dr. Martha Bulyk_

I utilized R to perform protein-binding microarray data analysis on the DNA binding patterns of the reference and alternative isoforms of two disease-associated TF genes: OTX2 and TBX5. My analysis expanded on existing knowledge of human TF binding diversity and pointed to the importance of understanding TF isoforms. 


**RNA-seq Analysis of Sex Differences in the Striatum Cocaine Response of NOD Mice**

_Laboratory of Dr. Elissa Chesler_

I conducted RNA-seq analysis and found that female NOD mice showed significant differences in cocaine-induced striatum gene expression, while the male NOD mice showed no significant differences. Using AMIGO for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, I identified Pprcl and Nr4a1 as candidate genes that could play a more significant role in sex differences in cocaine response. 


**The effects of enriched environment on learning and memory in Long Evans rats**

_Laboratory of Dr. Christina McKittrick_

I performed behavioral tests, such as the forced swim test, the elevated zero maze, and the Morris water maze to see if maternal separation had lasting effects on various behaviors. I was responsible for scheduling and running various behavior assays as well as statistical and graphical analysis of the behavioral data.
