I have been fortunate to work in many labs as my interests are mainly focused on drug addiction and mental health using animal models and bioinformatic tools.

**Investigate the role of gut microbiome disruptions in a rodent model of opioid use disorder**
    _Laboratory of Dr. Drew Kiraly_

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, The Department of Translational Psychiatry 

I worked on a project to establish a mechanistic link between the adolescent gut microbiome, the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and opioid self-administration. 

**Investigated the effects of enriched environment on learning and memory in Long Evans rats**
_Laboratory of Dr. Christina McKittrick_
Drew University, Department of Neuroscience

**Explore the effect of housing conditions on anxiety behaviors and cocaine-induced sensitized locomotor activity in C57BL/6J mice**
_Laboratory of Dr. Christina McKittrick_
Drew University, Department of Neuroscience

**Using Protein Binding Microarrays to analyze DNA binding differences of Human Transcription Factor Isoforms**
_Laboratory of Dr. Martha Bulyk_
Harvard Medical School, Department of Medicine in the Division of Genetics

**In Vivo 3D Analysis of Kinematics of Canine Diaphragm Muscle and Lower Rib Cage**
_Laboratory of Dr. Aladin Boriek_
Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Medicine and Physiology

**RNA-seq Analysis of Sex Differences in the Striatum Cocaine Response of NOD Mice**
_Laboratory of Dr. Elissa Chesler_
The Jackson Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics/Genomics
