I have been fortunate to work in many labs as my interests are mainly focused on drug addiction and mental health using animal models and bioinformatic tools.

**Investigate the role of gut microbiome disruptions in a rodent model of opioid use disorder**
_Laboratory of Dr. Drew Kiraly_

I worked to establish a mechanistic link between the adolescent gut microbiome, the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and opioid self-administration. The current project will build upon our preliminary results to investigate the role of the adolescent gut microbiome on fentanyl self-administration and seek a mechanistic understanding of its influence by examining the contribution of the gut microbiome-derived metabolites in opioid reward behavior and chromatin modification in mPFC. My portion of the project was to test the hypothesis that adolescence is a sensitive period for microbiome-driven effects on opioid self-administration and opioid-induced histone modification. 

**Explore the effect of housing conditions on anxiety behaviors and cocaine-induced sensitized locomotor activity in C57BL/6J mice**

**Using Protein Binding Microarrays to analyze DNA binding differences of Human Transcription Factor Isoforms**
_Laboratory of Dr. Martha Bulyk_

I utilized R to perform protein-binding microarray data analysis on the DNA binding patterns of the reference and alternative isoforms of two disease-associated TF genes: OTX2 and TBX5. My analysis expanded on existing knowledge of human TF binding diversity and pointed to the importance of understanding TF isoforms. As a result of this research experience, I presented both oral and poster presentations at the Virtual Leadership Alliance National Symposium (LANS), ABRCMS, and the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). Presenting my research at the various conferences gave me valuable experience in effectively communicating my science to the broader scientific community. As a result, I was recognized with an award for an outstanding presentation at SACNAS 2020.

**RNA-seq Analysis of Sex Differences in the Striatum Cocaine Response of NOD Mice**
_Laboratory of Dr. Elissa Chesler_

I investigated how sex differences play a significant role in cocaine dependence. I performed RNA-seq analysis and found that female NOD mice showed significant differences in cocaine-induced striatum gene expression, while the male NOD mice showed no significant differences. Using AMIGO for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, I identified Pprcl and Nr4a1 as candidate genes that could play a more significant role in sex differences in cocaine response. 

**Investigated the effects of enriched environment on learning and memory in Long Evans rats**
_Laboratory of Dr. Christina McKittrick_

I performed behavioral tests, such as the forced swim test, the elevated zero maze, and the Morris water maze to see if maternal separation had lasting effects on various behaviors. I was responsible for scheduling and running various behavior assays as well as statistical and graphical analysis of the behavioral data.
